title: Human-Centered Security and Privacy Group at MPI-SP
permalink: /group/
---

I lead the Human-Centered Security and Privacy group at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy. My group is operating at full capacity now, although I might be hiring in 2024. Please feel free to get in touch if you are interested in my work or would like to explore collaboration opportunities.

<h2>How to apply?</h2>

<h3>Apply through MPI-SP affiliated programs</h3>

Applications to these programs are reviewed by faculty across several Max Planck Institutes performing computer science research, i.e., <a href="https://www.cis.mpg.de/">CS@MPI</a>. Please make sure to mention my name (e.g., when you are asked to identify potential faculty advisors and in your research statement) to help me identify your application.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cis.mpg.de/cs-max-planck/">CS@Max Planck doctoral program</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/maryland-max-planck">Maryland Max Planck Ph.D. Program</a> (students apply to the UMD graduate program first with the option to be considered for the joint program)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cis.mpg.de/internships/">CS@Max Planck internship program</a> (open to Bachelor's, Master's, and doctoral students as well as individuals from industry interested in gaining academic research experience)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Apply to me individually</h3>

If you are interested in working with me in particular (independent of the programs mentioned above), please email me with the following information:

<ul>
<li>Briefly introduce yourself, such as your educational background and research experiences</li>
<li>What you are looking for (e.g., an advisor, a dissertation committee member, a funded research assistantship, or some light exposure to research without formal commitment); indicate a time range if you are looking for a visiting position</li>
<li>1-2 paragraphs of your motivations and expectations regarding working with me  (e.g., you could state what you found interesting in one of my publications and how you would like to extend the work; alternatively, you could describe a particular research question you are set on exploring, your thoughts of why that question is important and how you think we could work together) </li>
<li>Your CV and transcript</li>
<li>Name and contact information of 2-3 references who can provide letters of recommendation upon request</li>
</ul>

I may not be able to respond to every email --- please do not take it personally, as this reflects my limited bandwidth and does not say anything about your strengths and merits --- but I promise to read your email.

<h2>Want to have an informal chat?</h2>

Absolutely! I am happy to answer any questions you may have via email or set up a time to talk. I also offer public office hours (time permitting) --- schedule via <a href="https://calendly.com/yixinz/virtual-office-hours">Calendly</a>.

Want to assess if there is a good fit between my work and your interests before reaching out? Feel free to take a look at my <a target="_blank" href="https://yixinzou.github.io/statements/zou-research.pdf">research statement</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://yixinzou.github.io/statements/zou-teaching.pdf">teaching statement</a> (last updated: January 2022) to get a sense of my research interests and mentoring philosophy.
