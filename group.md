I will join MPI-SP in January 2023 as a tenure-track faculty member leading the Human-Centered Security and Privacy group. If you are interested in being a postdoc, a Ph.D. student, or an intern in my group, feel free to get in touch with me.

<h2>How to apply?</h2>

There are several programs affiliated with MPI-SP (with fixed deadlines for applications):

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cis.mpg.de/cs-max-planck/">CS@Max Planck doctoral program</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/maryland-max-planck">Maryland Max Planck Ph.D. Program</a> (students apply to the UMD graduate program with the option to be considered for the joint program)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cis.mpg.de/internships/">CS@Max Planck internship program</a> (open to Bachelor's, Master's, and doctoral students as well as individuals from industry interested in gaining academic research experience)</li>
</ul>

If you apply through these standardized programs, you do not need to contact me individually, but please make sure to list me as a potential faculty advisor in your application.

In addition, you are welcome to apply to me individually (e.g., for postdoc positions or short-term visiting positions outside the CS@Max Planck application cycle). When applying, please include the following information:

<ul>
<li>Your CV</li>
<li>What you are looking for (e.g., an advisor, a dissertation committee member, a funded research assistantship, or some light exposure to research without formal commitment)</li>
<li>1-2 paragraphs describing your area of interest and any topics you can see us working on together</li>
<li>1-2 relevant publications (when applicable, not a must)</li>
<li>Name and contact information of 2-3 references who can provide letters of recommendation upon request</li>
</ul>

<h2>Want to have an informal chat?</h2>

Absolutely! I am happy to answer any questions you may have via email or set up a time to talk. I also offer public office hours (time permitting) -- schedule via <a href="https://calendly.com/yixinz">Calendly</a>.

Want to assess if there could be a mutual fit between us before reaching out? Feel free to take a look at my <a target="_blank" href="https://yixinzou.github.io/statements/zou-research.pdf">research statement</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://yixinzou.github.io/statements/zou-teaching.pdf">teaching statement</a> (last updated: January 2022) to get a sense of my research interests and mentoring philosophy.
