I"¶<p>I will join MPI-SP in January 2023 as a tenure-track faculty member leading the Human-Centered Security and Privacy group. My group will have openings for a postdoc, a Ph.D. student, and several interns/visiting scholars.</p>

<h2>How to apply?</h2>

<p>There are several programs affiliated with MPI-SP (with fixed deadlines for applications):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cis.mpg.de/cs-max-planck/">CS@Max Planck doctoral program</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/maryland-max-planck">Maryland Max Planck Ph.D. Program</a> (students apply to the UMD graduate program with the option to be considered for the joint program)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cis.mpg.de/internships/">CS@Max Planck internship program</a> (open to Bachelor's, Master's, and doctoral students as well as individuals from industry interested in gaining academic research experience)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you apply through these standardized programs, you are encouraged to mention my name in your application (e.g., when you are asked to identify potential faculty advisors and in your statement). Feel free to reach out to me prior to applying if you would like to. I may not be able to get back to you â€” this does not say anything about your strengths and merits, it just means I receive way more emails than I can attend to. Please be assured that I will see and carefully review your application if you have indicated interest in working with me, whether you contact me prior to applying or not.</p>

<p>In addition, you are welcome to contact me individually if you are applying for postdoc positions or visiting positions outside the CS@Max Planck application cycle. When contacting me, please include the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Briefly introduce yourself, such as educational background and research experiences</li>
<li>What you are looking for (e.g., an advisor, a dissertation committee member, a funded research assistantship, or some light exposure to research without formal commitment); indicate a time range if you are looking for a visiting position</li>
<li>1-2 paragraphs of your motivations and expectations regarding working with me (e.g., you could state what you found interesting in one of my publications and how you would like to extend the work; alternatively, you could describe a particular research question you are set on exploring, your thoughts of why that question is important and how you think we could work together) </li>
<li>Your CV ans transcript</li>
<li>Name and contact information of 2-3 references who can provide letters of recommendation upon request</li>
</ul>

<h2>Want to have an informal chat?</h2>

<p>Absolutely! I am happy to answer any questions you may have via email or set up a time to talk. I also offer public office hours (time permitting) â€” schedule via <a href="https://calendly.com/yixinz">Calendly</a>.</p>

<p>Want to assess if there is a good fit between my work and your interests before reaching out? Feel free to take a look at my <a target="_blank" href="https://yixinzou.github.io/statements/zou-research.pdf">research statement</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://yixinzou.github.io/statements/zou-teaching.pdf">teaching statement</a> (last updated: January 2022) to get a sense of my research interests and mentoring philosophy.</p>
