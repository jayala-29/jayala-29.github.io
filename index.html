<p>Hello there! Thanks for thinking I'm interesting enough to check up on. If you've come this far, I dare you to say hello before you leave :)<br><br>

My name is Yixin Zou (pronounced "Yee-Shin Zoh"). I am a PhD candidate at University of Michigan, School of Information
(<a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">UMSI</a>) advised by <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Dr. Florian Schaub.</a>
I am part of the Security and Privacy Interaction (SPI) Lab and the Michigan Interactive and Social Computing (MISC) group.
I also work closely with the <a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a> team at Carnegie Mellon University, the <a href="https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu/">GWUSEC</a> Lab at George Washington University, and a research team based in New York City that studies <a href="https://www.ipvtechresearch.org/">computer security and privacy issues for survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV)</a>.<br><br>

My main research focuses on understanding and improving user behaviors in the face of privacy and security threats, e.g., when their personal information is compromised in a data breach, or when they want to exercise privacy choices on websites. I am also involved in research on understanding the privacy risks and expectations of exposure-sensitive populations, such as IPV survivors, older adults, and children.<br><br>
