<p>Hello there! Thanks for thinking I'm interesting enough to check up on. If you've come this far, I dare you to say hello before you leave :)<br><br>

My name is Yixin Zou (pronounced "Yee-Shin Zoh"). I am a PhD Candidate at University of Michigan, School of Information
(<a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">UMSI</a>) advised by <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Florian Schaub.</a>
I am part of the Security and Privacy Interaction (SPI) Lab and the Michigan Interactive and Social Computing (MISC) group.
I also work closely with the <a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a> team at Carnegie Mellon University, the <a href="https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu/">GWUSEC</a> Lab at George Washington University, and a research team based in New York City that studies <a href="https://www.ipvtechresearch.org/">computer security and privacy issues for survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV)</a>.<br><br>

My research focuses on understanding and improving people's adoption of protective behaviors against privacy and security threats (e.g., reacting to data breaches, exercising website privacy choices, and navigating privacy risks in smart homes). A second line of my research investigates the privacy risks and needs of vulnerable populations, such as survivors of intimate partner violence and older adults. My research has been published at top HCI and security venues including <a href="https://chi.acm.org/">CHI</a>, <a href="https://cscw.acm.org/">CSCW</a>, and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21">USENIX Security</a>. I'm also interested in making my research relevant to policymakers: I've been an invited speaker at the US Federal Trade Commission's annual PrivacyCon, and a series of work with my CMU collaborators has directly influenced the California Consumer Privacy Act's <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/about-umsi/news/umsi-researchers-design-privacy-icon-be-used-california-law">rulemaking process</a>. <br><br>

<img src="/images/speaker.png" width="20">  <b>I will be on the job market in Fall 2021, open to both academia and industry positions. If you have or know any opening in privacy, security, human-computer interaction or adjacent areas, I'd love to get in touch!</b>
