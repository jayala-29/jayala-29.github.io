<p>Hello there! Thanks for thinking I'm interesting enough to check up on. If you've come this far, I dare you to say hello before you leave :)<br><br>

My name is Yixin Zou (pronounced "Yee-Shin Zoh")/邹熠欣. I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan, School of Information
(<a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">UMSI</a>) advised by <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Prof. Florian Schaub.</a>
I am part of the Security and Privacy Interaction (SPI) Lab and the Michigan Interactive and Social Computing (MISC) group.
I also work closely with the <a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a> team at Carnegie Mellon University,
and a research team based in New York City that studies <a href="https://www.ipvtechresearch.org/">computer security and privacy issues in the context of intimate partner violence</a>.<br><br>

My research interests lie in the intersection of security, privacy, and human-computer interactions.
I study topics such as data breach notifications, phishing/malware warnings, and website privacy choices,
trying to understand users' behavior and preference in these contexts and how to better motivate users to take actions
in face of threats through HCI and interaction design.<br><br>
