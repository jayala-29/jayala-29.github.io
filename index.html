<p>Hello there! Thanks for thinking I'm interesting enough to check up on. If you've come this far, I encourage you to say hello before you leave :)<br><br>

My name is Yixin Zou (pronounced "Yee-Shin Zoh"). I am a PhD Candidate at 
<a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan, School of Information</a> advised by <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Florian Schaub.</a>
I am part of the Security and Privacy Interaction (SPI) Lab, the Michigan Interactive and Social Computing (MISC) group, and the Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing (ESC).
I also work closely with the <a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a> team at Carnegie Mellon University, the <a href="https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu/">GWUSEC</a> Lab at George Washington University, and a New York City-based research team that studies <a href="https://www.ipvtechresearch.org/">computer security and privacy issues for survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV)</a>.<br><br>

My research is broadly about usable security and privacy. I study factors that prevent people from adopting security and privacy protective measures, as well as the unique threat models and safety needs of at-risk populations (e.g., survivors of intimate partner violence and older adults). Based on such knowledge, I develop human-centered solutions that combine technology, policy, and
education to help people protect themselves from perceived risks. My research has been published at top HCI and security venues including <a href="https://chi.acm.org/">CHI</a>, <a href="https://cscw.acm.org/">CSCW</a>, and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21">USENIX Security</a>. I'm also interested in making my research relevant to policymakers: I've been an invited speaker at the US Federal Trade Commission's annual PrivacyCon, and a series of work with my CMU collaborators has directly influenced the California Consumer Privacy Act's <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/about-umsi/news/umsi-researchers-design-privacy-icon-be-used-california-law">rulemaking process</a>. <br><br>

<img src="/images/speaker.png" width="20">  <b>I am on the job market in 2021-2022, open to both tenure-track faculty positions and industry research-focused positions. If you have or know any opening in HCI, security/privacy, or adjacent areas, I'd love to get in touch!
