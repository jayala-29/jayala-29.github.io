<p>Hello there! :)<br><br>

My name is Jessy Ayala. I am a PhD Student at the <a href="https://uci.edu/">University of California, Irvine</a> in Irvine, CA, where I am a member of the SORA Lab research group under <a href="https://jgarcia.ics.uci.edu/">Joshua Garcia</a>. My CV is available <a target="_blank" href="https://jayala-29.github.io/cv/ayala-cv.pdf">here</a>.<br><br>

I study questions centered around securing the open-source ecosystem. My current research investigates software vulnerability management (SVM), which is the collection of approaches, processes, and activities undertaken by software developers and security professionals to ensure the security and privacy of software systems and prevent or protect against associated attacks.<br><br>

Want a brief highlight of my work? Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXh7l3PndZg&list=PLVl2hFL_zAh-QFg2qVal48qD2a7Aqh-wM&index=46">a talk I gave</a> at an OpenSSF event in October 2024 regarding vulnerability disclosure practices in open-source. <br><br>

Before joining UC Irvine, I earned my MS in Cybersecurity from New York University, advised by <a href="https://hdanny.org/">Danny Huang</a>.

If you are interested in any form of advising or collaboration, please read my recent work before contacting me.<br><br>
