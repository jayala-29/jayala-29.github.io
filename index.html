<p>Hello there! Thanks for thinking I'm interesting enough to check up on. If you've come this far, I dare you to say hello before you leave :)<br><br>

My name is Yixin Zou (pronounced "Yee-Shin Zoh"). I am a PhD candidate at University of Michigan, School of Information
(<a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">UMSI</a>) advised by <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Florian Schaub.</a>
I am part of the Security and Privacy Interaction (SPI) Lab and the Michigan Interactive and Social Computing (MISC) group.
I also work closely with the <a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a> team at Carnegie Mellon University, the <a href="https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu/">GWUSEC</a> Lab at George Washington University, and a research team based in New York City that studies <a href="https://www.ipvtechresearch.org/">computer security and privacy issues for survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV)</a>.<br><br>

My primary research focuses on (1) understanding and improving users' adoption of protective behaviors in the face of privacy and security threats, and (2) examining the privacy risks and needs of exposure-sensitive populations such as IPV survivors and older adults. My research has been published at venues such as <a href="https://chi.acm.org/">CHI</a>, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21">USENIX Security</a> and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2021">SOUPS</a> with several best paper awards and honorable mentions. I'm also interested in exploring my research's relevance to policymakers: I've been an invited speaker at the US Federal Trade Commission's annual <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/privacycon-2020">PrivacyCon</a>, and a series of work with my CMU collaborators has directly influenced the California Consumer Privacy Act's <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa/current">rulemaking process</a>. <br><br>
