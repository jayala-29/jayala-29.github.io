<p>Hello there! Thanks for thinking I'm interesting enough to check up on. If you've come this far, I encourage you to say hello before you leave :)<br><br>

My name is Yixin Zou (pronounced "Yee-Shin Zoh"). I am an incoming tenure-track faculty member at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sp.org/">Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy</a> in Bochum, Germany. I completed my Ph.D. in Information at the University of Michigan, advised by <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Florian Schaub</a>. <br><br>

My research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction, privacy, and security. I work on developing approaches that help consumers better adopt protective behaviors in the face of privacy and security threats, as well as understanding the unique barriers faced by marginalized/vulnerable populations in protecting themselves. My CV is available <a target="_blank" href="https://yixinzou.github.io/cv/zou-cv.pdf">here</a>.<br><br>

<!-- <img src="/images/speaker.png" width="20"> <b>I will have openings for postdocs, PhD students, and research interns for my group at MPI-SP starting from January 2023. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working with me.
