<p>Hello there! Thanks for thinking I'm interesting enough to check up on. If you've come this far, I dare you to say hello before you leave.<br><br>

My name is Yixin Zou (pronounced "Yee-Shin Zhoh")/邹熠欣. I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan, School of Information (<a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">UMSI</a>) advised by <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Dr. Florian Schaub.</a><br><br>

My research interests lie in the intersection of security, privacy, and human-computer interactions. I study topics such as data breach notifications, phishing/malware warnings, and website privacy choices, trying to understand users' behavior and preference in these contexts and how we can better motivate users to take actions in face of threats through HCI and interaction design.<br><br>
