I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Michigan, School of Information advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Florian Schaub</a>. My research interests are broadly in the areas of usable privacy and security, specifically understanding and supporting users' self-protective behavior in face of security and privacy threats. My work spans multiple contexts such as data breach notifications, anti-phishing warnings, and website privacy choices.

I am a member of the Security and Privacy Interaction (SPI) Labï¼Œ<a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/">Michigan Interactive and Social Computing (MISC)</a> group, and <a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a>.
