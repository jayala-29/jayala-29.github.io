I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Michigan, School of Information. My research interests are broadly in the areas of usable privacy and security, specifically understanding and supporting users' self-protective behavior in face of security and privacy threats. My work spans multiple contexts such as data breach notifications, anti-phishing warnings, and website privacy choices.

I am advised by Dr. Florian Schaub. I am a member of the Security and Privacy Interaction (SPI) Lab at the University of Michiganï¼Œthe <a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/">Michigan Interactive and Social Computing (MISC) group</a>, and the <a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a> team at the Carnegie Mellon University.
