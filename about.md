I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Michigan, School of Information advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/florian-schaub">Florian Schaub</a>. My research interests are broadly in the areas of usable privacy and security, specifically understanding and supporting users' self-protective behavior in face of security and privacy threats. My work spans multiple contexts such as data breach notifications, anti-phishing warnings, and website privacy choices. Prior to my PhD journey, I received a Bachelor of Science in Advertising from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

At Michigan, I am actively involved in the Security and Privacy Interaction (SPI) Lab and the <a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/">Michigan Interactive and Social Computing (MISC)</a> group. I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/">Usable Privacy Policy Project</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.
